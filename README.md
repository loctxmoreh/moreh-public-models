# MOREH AI Framework - Hyperscale AI Projects
## Popular model validated
Open-source models in this repo was validated and working in MOREH AI Framework, please follow script guideline in corresponding README.md to prepare data and train the model. \r
Note: each model in this repo exists as git submodule, to get fully code, please use this command (it take a bit longer than usual):
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/moreh-dev/moreh-public-models.git
```
See more about `git submodule` at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
